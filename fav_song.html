        <h1><big><u>MY FAVOURITE SONGS</u></big></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Music has always been a vast landscape for me, a journey spanning the grandiosity of classical compositions to the infectious energy of modern pop. Yet, among the thousands of melodies I’ve heard, only a select few truly pierce the silence of my soul. There is a specific, haunting beauty in the way songs like <b>Kaifi Khalil’s Kahani Suno 2.0</b> or <b>Anuv Jain’s Husn</b> capture the ache of a breaking heart, echoing the timeless, soulful depth of <b>Kailash Kher’s Teri Deewani</b>. While I find myself mesmerized by the modern mastery of <b>Arijit Singh</b>, I am always pulled back to the nostalgic magic of <b>Kishore Kumar</b>; specifically, the breezy, moonlit romance of <b>Yeh Raatein Yeh Mausam</b> remains the ultimate anchor of my musical heart.</p>
        <p>This same emotional thread weaves through my love for English music, where I am drawn to melodies that feel like a raw, honest confession. Whether it is the desperate crescendo of <b>Tom Odell’s Another Love</b>, the cinematic weight of <b>Adele’s Skyfall</b>, or the delicate vulnerability of <b>Ruth B’s Dandelions</b>, I find myself seeking sounds that mirror my own inner world. Every artist, from the rhythmic soul of <b>Libianca</b> to the quirky melancholy of <b>Ricky Montgomery</b>, plays a part in my story, but it is <b>Gigi Perez’s Sailor Song</b> that currently holds my heart closest, serving as a gentle, melodic reminder of the feelings words often fail to express.</p>
