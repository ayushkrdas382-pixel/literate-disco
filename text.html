            Hello everyone myself <b>Ayush Das</b>. I am a fairly average student. Currently I am a <b>1st year</b> student of <b>civil engineering</b> branch at <b>CGEC</b>. This is my first website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was contemplating on what topic my website should be on but then I had an idea that if I share my interests with the people visiting my website I will be able to connect with like-minded people from my college so this website is just going to be about my favourite things.
        </p>
